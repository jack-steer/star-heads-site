# Star Heads Site

This project contains the source code for a front-end application which displays players in Fifa video game that have star heads (game faces). This will be initially set up for FIFA 23

## What is a star head?

This is where a player has had there face scanned and then imported into the game. These scans bring authenticity to the game, otherwise generic faces are applied. The issue is that within the game, there is not a way of filtering players based on whether they have had a scan. In addition at the time of writing, there is not a site on the internet which provides players that have had a scan.
